intro:
  - excerpt: 'I specialise mostly in backend engineering with .Net Core. I love working in really high-throughput environments, as I am passionate about scalability, high performance and distributed computing. On an average weekend, you would probably find me engaging in competitive programming on HackerRank, playing computer games with friends, or exploring London.'
